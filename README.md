Journal.ly is an application where every user can create an account, and begin their journey to journalling. Journalling allows people to be more conscientious about their day-to-day routines. The users can look back at the app and make a note of their habits and progress. Journal.ly will help users monitor their daily mood patterns.mJournal.ly provides its users with features for mood-tracking, progress reports, reminders, and daily-entry journals.

Journal.ly is to run on both Android and iOS mobile platforms. This provides the application with exposure to a large market because most people use one of those operating systems on their phones. Choosing mobile platforms also provides a larger audience than a traditional desktop application. With a Cross-Platform development framework such as Flutter, the code can be written once and compiled to both platforms, so supporting multiple operating systems will not require additional development time.

In our project, we have created two platforms. We are using Firebase as our database manager. We will collect user email Ids and store them in the database. Once the user has registered, they do not need to register again and can directly log in. Our app consists of four pages, the home, login, calendar, welcome, journal and settings page.
